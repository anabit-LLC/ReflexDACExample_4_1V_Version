# ReflexDACExample_4_1V_Version
This example Arduino sketch is meant to work with Anabit's Reflex DAC 14 Bit 2MSPS bipolar output +/- 4.096 open source reference design. This example sketch demonstrates how to output 4 different voltage patterns from the 14 bit DAC. This portable version targets ANY Arduino board with hardware SPI.
